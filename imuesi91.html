        <!--This is not a prfect Html example but i hope to get better in the next trials-->
        <p>Love is arguably the most talked about verb in the dictionary, in our world today.</p>
Here is a lyric of the song done by 10cc called things we do for love from Genius Website:
  <blockquote><span style="color:purple;">
    <p>"Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river</p> 
    <p>Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea</p> 
    <p>You lay your bets and then you pay the price" </span></p></blockquote>

The lyrics above speaks about how much can be saved if genuine love is shown... examples are as follows:
<ol> <li>The essennce of religion(Worshiping whatever god you believe in) would be evident in our daily lives.</li>
      <li>If we truly love our neighbours as the bible teaches, there would hardly be killings in the country.</li>
      <li>When we lookout for one another, loneliness would be a thing of the past.</li>
</ol>
The above examples can be achieved if;
<ul>
    <li>We practice what we preach.</li>
    <li>We Remember we only live once, after which is death and judgement.</li>
    <li>We live and let live.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to a wikipedia link:</p>

    Imagine how diversed we are, but yet we can be one people if only we chose love above all other things.
